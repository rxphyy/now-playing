This mod lets you view what song is currently playing on your PC without the need for you to Alt-Tab all the time to check. It displays a clear overlay in-game to allow you to keep the shuffle going on and not have to interrupt your mining to check who, what, where, when is playing in your headphones!

### üñ•Ô∏è Completely local

No weird sign-ins to any music service, no authorization needed; This mod runs completely local on **your** computer.

<details>
  <summary>üì° How is that possible?</summary>
  
  The mod utilizes a C# console application that runs in the background to fetch what is currently playing on your PC via <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/?view=winrt-26100">WinRT</a>. It hosts this data locally in a Web server, which the mod can then fetch easily via HTTP.
  
  <br>
  
  When the game is running, you can even access these URLs yourself to see it in action:

  ---
  <a href="http://localhost:58888/media-info" target="blank">
    <pre><strong>/media_info</strong> üéµ</pre>
  </a>
  This URL will show you what is currently playing on your computer and includes info such as the title, the artist's name, the app that's currently playing the media (ex.: "Spotify.exe"), the playing status (ex.: "Playing", "Paused"), the current timeline position, the start time and the end time (duration/length) of the media.

  </a>
  üö® Don't be alarmed, but when opening this one, if anything was playing on your computer, it will paused, and if you open it again, well it should play again. This is completely normal and is how the mod can provide play/pause controls.

  <a href="http://localhost:58888/skip-next" target="blank">
    <pre>GET<strong> /skip-next ‚è≠Ô∏è</strong></pre>
  </a>
  üö® This URL should skip the currently playing media and go the next one, so don't be alarmed if it skips your favorite song when opening it up.
  <a href="http://localhost:58888/skip-previous" target="blank">
    <pre>GET<strong> /skip-previous ‚èÆÔ∏è</strong></pre>
  </a>
  üö® Uno reverses the URL above it.
